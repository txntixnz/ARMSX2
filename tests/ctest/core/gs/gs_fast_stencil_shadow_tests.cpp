// Pins the fast stencil shadow road (GS/Renderers/Common/GSFastStencilShadow.h): which devices
// take it, which draws take it, and which engine leaves the counter unsplit.
//
// The device rule has no setting behind it, so these cases are the whole contract. It is on for
// Vulkan with dual-source blending on three roads -- the copy road, the backend's own per-draw
// barriers on the M2 where that was measured, and a declared feedback loop -- and off on the
// in-tile read and on desktop Vulkan's barrier road. Two cases matter most. D3D11 also runs without texture barriers, and reading "no barriers"
// as "frame reads are expensive" would put a draw the D3D11 shader cannot express on a backend
// where the read it replaces is cheap. And the rule names its roads rather than asking
// `road != Copy`, because the loose form would also admit the in-tile read: Mali's default, and
// where an Adreno with OverrideTextureBarriers=1 lands. OffWhenBarriersAreForcedOnWithoutA-
// Declaration is the case that catches that, and it is the reason the spelling matters.
//
// The device rows below are walked from the road policy rather than asserted, because the fact the
// rule reads is GSSelfReadRoadDecision::road and a test that hand-writes the road cannot catch the
// road policy moving under it.

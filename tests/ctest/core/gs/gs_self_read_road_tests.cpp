// Pins the self-read road decision (GS/Renderers/Common/GSSelfReadRoadPolicy.h).
//
// A draw that reads the render target it is writing takes one of three roads: clone the target,
// read it in the pass with our own barriers ordering it, or read it in the pass and let the driver
// order it. Which one a device takes used to be four expressions spread over 150 lines of
// GSDeviceVK::CheckFeatures, and reading them in order was the only way to find out.
//
// What these tests are mostly for is the no-change half. The declared-loop road adds a
// third road for ONE part -- Adreno under Turnip, declaring an attachment feedback loop so the
// driver runs the pass untiled with a coherent destination read -- and every other device must come
// out of the function with exactly the bits it had before. None of those devices is the one that
// takes the new road, so "it still works on desktop" cannot be checked by running the new arm.
// Hence a pure function and the old answers pinned here by name.
//
// The header carries the same matrix as static_asserts, which is what actually stops a regression
// compiling. These exist so a failure says which DEVICE moved rather than which line.
//
// Rides gs_vertex_tests -- the policy is header-only constexpr, so it needs no extra linkage.

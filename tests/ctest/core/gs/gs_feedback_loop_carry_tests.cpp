// Pins the feedback-loop carry decision (GS/Renderers/Common/GSFeedbackLoopCarryPolicy.h).
//
// The carry keeps a render pass open across a run of draws on one target once one of them has
// declared the pass self-reading, instead of ending the pass to clear the flag for the next
// non-reader. It exists because a tiler pays a full tile store and reload at every pass boundary,
// and on the framebuffer-fetch path the flag costs nothing to leave set.
//
// The rule is that a run may be latched wherever the ROAD orders the read, and there are three
// ways a road does that: rasterization-order attachment access on the framebuffer-fetch path
// (Mali), the driver's own coherent primitive mode on the attachment-feedback-loop layout path
// (Adreno under Turnip), and this backend's explicit per-draw feedback barriers on that same
// layout path, on the one device that was measured (Apple silicon under Honeykrisp, which takes
// the road by default). Desktop Vulkan reaches the same road and does not carry.
//
// What these tests are for is the other half: a road with no ordering must reach exactly the
// behaviour it had before, and most of those combinations cannot be produced on any machine in
// the building. So the decision was written as a pure function and every row is pinned here by
// name -- the copy road, the layout road with texture barriers off, and each road's term proven
// not to leak into the other's answer.
//
// Rides gs_vertex_tests -- the policy is header-only constexpr, so it needs no extra linkage.

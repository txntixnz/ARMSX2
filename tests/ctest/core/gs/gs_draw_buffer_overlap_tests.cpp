// The rect GSState::CheckOverlapVertsSlow compares an incoming primitive against.
//
// That heuristic asks a question about native PS2 geometry -- "is this primitive
// inside what the buffered draw already covers, so the order matters?" -- and it
// must therefore get the same answer at every upscale. It used to get a different
// one, because its incoming box is the raw window box in native pixels at every
// scale while the buffered rect it was tested against was the shipped draw rect,
// which above native keeps its raw sub-texel extent AND takes every primitive the
// finer cull grid lets through, including the ones that paint no native pixel.
//
// GSVertexKernels::PrimNativeDrawRect is the buffered rect asked on the native
// grid instead. What these cases pin:
//   * at the native grid it is bit-identical to the shipped rect, so native
//     resolution is a structural no-op rather than a gated one;
//   * for the same geometry it is the same rect at 1x, 2x and 4x;
//   * a primitive that paints no native pixel contributes nothing, which is what
//     the native cull does with it;
//   * the point and line classes, which the shipped rect does not round either,
//     keep the shipped rect at every grid;
//   * the shape of the real draw this came from -- Stuntman's s_n 28, which merged
//     at 1x and flushed at 2x -- now answers the same at both.

// Pins the copy-road blending cap (GS/Renderers/Common/GSCopyRoadBlendingPolicy.h).
//
// One title, Splashdown, renders at Minimum blending accuracy on a device that pays for its
// destination read on every draw that takes one -- by copying the render target, or by emitting a
// pipeline barrier. On the copy road that read costs it 1,177 target copies and 8.48 ms a frame;
// on an Adreno 740's barrier road it costs 59,023 barriers and +40%. The Minimum picture was
// judged acceptable, and the capped barrier road measured byte-identical to the copy
// road it was judged on. Where the driver orders the
// read for us the read is free, and the title renders exactly as it did.
//
// So almost all of what these tests are for is the "everywhere else". The change is visible on two
// roads, on one title; every other combination of device facts and every other title has to be
// bit-for-bit what it was, and most of those combinations cannot be observed on any machine this
// suite runs on. Pinning them by name here is what makes "nothing else moved" a statement rather
// than a hope.
//
// Rides gs_vertex_tests -- the policy is header-only constexpr, so it needs no extra linkage.

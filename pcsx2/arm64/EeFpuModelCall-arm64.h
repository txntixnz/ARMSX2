/*	Reaching the EE FPU model from a recompiler.

	EEFPU_MODEL_CALL (EeFpuModel.h) spares q8-q31 and x9-x30, which is where
	both VU engines keep their state -- microVU's VFs, Q/P pipeline and VI
	cache, the EE's pinned GPRs and COP2 VF cache -- so no allocator is flushed
	and no pin mirror is written back. The stub saves the caller's own half of
	the convention: x2-x8, the x30 that the bl to it wrote, and the low vector
	registers.

	That half is the same wherever the model is reached from, so one stub per
	target serves every site and the site emits a bl and nothing else. Deciding
	the set by walking an allocator instead would have to happen at the site,
	and cannot: each op answers the zero divisor first and only the other arm
	reaches the model, and a flush marks registers clean at compile time for a
	path that runs conditionally.

	The vector half is per target. kVec* is one past the last q register the
	target's closure reaches, so a stub carries only what its own callee can
	dirty, and iFPUd-arm64.cpp's islands read the same extents for a spill they
	emit at the site. The GPR half is not worth splitting, since 17 of the 18
	targets reach x8. Nothing on the callee's side holds it to the declaration,
	so model_call_contract_tests walks each shipped closure and fails on a q
	register at or above the extent it was generated with.

	The GPRs are stored below the vectors so that both halves stay inside their
	addressing modes: STP's offset is a signed 7-bit multiple of the operand
	size, and the fallback frame is wide enough that vectors first would push
	the GPR pairs past it.  */

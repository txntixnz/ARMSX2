// Whether a backend may keep the feedback-loop flag set across a run of draws on one target.
//
// The backend ends a render pass whenever the feedback-loop flag word of the draw it is about to
// submit differs from the flag word the open pass was built with (GSDeviceVK::OMSetRenderTargets).
// A draw that reads the render target sets that flag; a draw that does not, clears it. So a single
// reader sitting between two non-readers costs two pass boundaries, and on a tiler a pass boundary
// is a full tile store and reload.
//
// That price is only worth paying if declaring a pass self-reading costs something. On the
// framebuffer-fetch path it does not: the read is a tile-local subpassLoad under
// rasterization-order attachment access, and a pass declared self-reading by a draw that never
// reads is the same pass with one unused input attachment. So the flag can simply stay set:
//
//   once a target run has a reader, the flag stays set for the following non-readers on that
//   target until the pass ends for another reason.
//
// "Another reason" is every reason there already was -- a different colour or depth target, a
// colclip blit, a command-buffer submit -- none of which this touches.
//
// The decision is a pure function of the device's facts so it can be pinned without a device; the
// backend supplies the facts. See gs_feedback_loop_carry_tests.cpp.
//
// This shipped for one round behind EmuCore/GS/FeedbackLoopCarry so the device suite could run both
// arms off one binary. The round decided it: on the RG 477V with fetch on, frames are identical
// with and without the carry on all 22 corpus dumps, while OutRun 2006 goes from 599.5 render
// passes a frame to 31.1 and Xenosaga from 75,899 per run to 133, taking its frame time from about
// 32 ms to 16.7. The key is gone; the carry is what the function returns.
//
// The attachment-feedback-loop LAYOUT road reaches the same conclusion by a different route, and
// the price it saves is larger. There the backend samples the attachment through an ordinary
// sampler while the image sits in VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_ATTACHMENT_FEEDBACK_LOOP_OPTIMAL_EXT: no input
// attachment, no subpassLoad (GSDeviceVK builds the input reference only when
// UseFeedbackLoopLayout() is false). What the declaration costs there is a pipeline create flag --
// every pipeline bound in a pass whose attachment is in that layout must carry
// VK_PIPELINE_CREATE_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_FEEDBACK_LOOP_BIT_EXT or the pass is undefined -- and the
// carry is what supplies it, because the word it ORs onto the following draws is the same
// pipeline-selector word those create flags are derived from. A latched pass is self-consistent:
// what keeps the pass open is what makes the pipelines inside it legal.
//
// Carried onto a non-reader the declaration states nothing that draw falsifies. The draw writes
// colour, which is what the pass was already for, and the ordering the loop declares is over a
// read it does not perform.
//
// On Adreno that road orders the read by itself, for a reason narrower than "it is a tiler": on
// Turnip the declaration is what makes the read coherent at all. The driver refuses to tile a
// pass containing a pipeline that declares a feedback loop which may involve textures, and on the
// untiled path that same
// declaration programs the primitive mode that orders the read. So the ordering comes from the
// driver, which is the invariant the fetch road gets from rasterization-order attachment access.
// The road was measured on an SD865 under Turnip/Mesa 26.1.2: God of
// War II's presented frames were identical across three runs of each arm and identical between
// the two roads, and its pass census is why this carry has to reach the road at all -- declaring
// the loop WITHOUT the carry raised the pass count on three of seven titles (Splashdown 4,766 to
// 9,451, Black 880 to 2,106, Brian Lara 228 to 435), which is exactly the alternation this file
// describes: a declared draw between two ordinary ones costs two pass boundaries.
//
// The M2 takes this road too -- Honeykrisp advertises no rasterization-order extension, so
// UseFeedbackLoopLayout() is true there by default -- and no driver primitive mode is doing
// anything for it. What IS true of it is that this backend orders the read itself: with texture
// barriers on, a draw that reads its own render target asks for a feedback barrier and SendHWDraw
// emits one, a framebuffer-local self-dependency inside the open pass. That is an ordering the
// road provides, exactly as the driver's primitive mode is on Adreno and rasterization-order
// access is on the fetch road. So the rule is CARRY WHERE THE ROAD ORDERS THE READ, and the layout
// road has two ways of doing that: the Adreno's driver, or this backend's own barriers.
//
// The barrier half is still scoped to the device it was measured on. Desktop NVIDIA, AMD and Intel
// drivers take the layout road with the same barriers, so the argument above applies to them
// word for word, but nobody has timed the carry there and it changes how their passes are cut.
// They keep the draw-local flag they always had until someone does.
//
// A carried non-reader needs no barrier, because it reads nothing. What the carry hands it is the
// pass's flag word, which is what supplies the pipeline create flag the FEEDBACK_LOOP_OPTIMAL
// layout requires of every pipeline bound in the pass; it does not make the draw sample anything.
// The barrier term below already excludes every draw that asks for a barrier of its own, so the
// carry can never be the thing that emits one.
//
// And the reader's own barrier still lands where it has to. A reader is excluded from the carry by
// that same barrier term, so it sets its own flag word from texture_barrier as it always did, and
// SendHWDraw issues the vkCmdPipelineBarrier inside the pass. That barrier is legal and it orders
// what it must, because a pass whose key carries color_feedback_loop declares the matching subpass
// self-dependency -- SHADER_READ in the fragment stage, on the layout road (GSDeviceVK's render
// pass builder) -- and the carry is precisely what keeps that key on the pass. The only thing that
// moves is WHICH pass the barrier sits in: without the carry the preceding non-readers ended the
// pass, so the reader's barrier opened a fresh one; with it, the barrier orders those same colour
// writes against the same sampler read inside one pass. Same two accesses, same order, one fewer
// boundary.
//
// The ADRENO half is reached when GSSelfReadRoadPolicy puts a Turnip device on the declared
// feedback loop (our driver build on Adreno 650 and up, or Turnip on Adreno 730 and up), which
// forces the layout spelling even though Turnip advertises rasterization-order access. Every other
// Adreno stays on the copy road and carries nothing.
//
// The BARRIER half is live on Apple silicon under Honeykrisp, the one device it was measured on.
// Its evidence is a byte-identity gate and a GPU-time A/B rather than a device census: on an M2
// Max, 94 presented-frame cells at 1x and 2x, base against carry.
//
// Where the layout carry is NOT free, and how to tell. Every pipeline in a latched pass carries
// the colour feedback-loop create flag, and a tiler may react to that flag by taking the pass out
// of tile memory. On Turnip it certainly does: the gmem-disable term is read from the pipeline
// create flag, ahead of the bandwidth autotuner, so the carry spreads the untiling from the
// reading draw to the whole latched run. On the seven-dump Adreno census that costs nothing,
// because the autotuner had already picked sysmem for those passes for its own reasons; it is not
// free in principle, and a title whose passes the autotuner tiles would pay tile-store bandwidth
// across the run.
//
// ⚠️ The general rule, and it binds every road in this file: DECLARING A FEEDBACK LOOP CAN COST
// TILE RESIDENCY ON ANY TILER, AND THE COST IS INVISIBLE TO PIXELS. A carry that trades thousands
// of pass boundaries for an untiled frame is byte-identical and slower. So neither the picture nor
// the pass count settles it -- the instruments are the driver's tiled/untiled mode census where
// one can be read, and GPU time where one cannot. The signature to look for is pass count DOWN
// with GPU time flat or UP.
//
// VK_EXT_attachment_feedback_loop_dynamic_state is the future way to keep the create flag off
// pipelines that never read, and the interesting part is that it would only work for those. On
// Turnip 26.1.2 the extension is advertised unconditionally and the dynamic value does reach the
// primitive mode, but the gmem-disable term is set only from the pipeline CREATE flag -- there is
// no dynamic path to it. So for the carried never-reading pipelines dynamic state would satisfy
// the validation rule without contributing to untiling, while for the declared READING draw the
// create flag IS the road: the untiling is what makes its read coherent, and the primitive mode
// alone inside a tiled pass is the incoherent case. That asymmetry is the note; it is source
// reading of Turnip 26.1.2, not a measurement, and nothing here builds on it.

// The depth bits say something about the pass that the colour bit does not. The read-only depth
// bit is set for a draw that samples the depth buffer it has attached, and the renderer only lets
// such a draw exist when it does not write depth (GSRendererHW::HandleTextureHazards' direct
// depth read requires !DepthWrite()). So a pass carrying the depth bits is a pass in which nothing
// wrote the depth being sampled -- and that, not any barrier, is what makes the in-tile depth
// sample well defined. Carrying the bits onto a depth WRITER states the opposite of what the draw
// does: it puts a depth writer and a depth sampler in one pass with nothing between them, and it
// leaves the depth image in the feedback/GENERAL layout while it is written. Rasterization-order
// depth access would order those two, but that subpass flag is set only when depth_feedback,
// framebuffer_fetch and vk_ext_roaa_depth all hold, so it cannot be relied on to cover this.
//
// The colour bit is safe under the same reasoning, which is why it is not gated here. There is no
// read-only colour flag to contradict: the colour attachment is written by every draw in the pass
// whether or not the bit is set, and FeedbackLoopFlag_ReadAndWriteRT adds an input-attachment
// reference, VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_GENERAL and -- on the fetch path -- the rasterization-order colour
// access subpass flag. Carried onto a non-reader that is an ordinary writer, that ADDS an ordering
// guarantee over a read the draw does not perform. Nothing it declares is falsified by writing
// colour, because writing colour is what the pass was already for.
//
// Both depth bits are dropped, not only the read-only one. Whether a draw that writes depth is
// safe inside a pass declared ReadAndWriteDepth is a question nothing here has measured, and the

// Which texel a device pixel reads when a sprite MINIFIES a texture that lives in GS memory and
// the sampler is nearest.
//
// The console evaluates a sprite's texture coordinate once per pixel, so a sprite whose U spans
// two source texels per screen pixel reads every other texel and never displays the ones in
// between. Games rely on that. NASCAR Thunder 2002 draws its distance haze as two half-screen
// sprites reading a 640-texel-wide PSMT8 overlay across 320 pixels, packed so the even texels
// carry the haze alpha and the odd texels are alpha 0. At native the odd ones are unreachable.
//
// Upscaling breaks the arithmetic, not the placement. At 2x the sprite covers twice as many device
// columns and every one of them gets its own sample point, so the texels the console never showed
// land on every second column: the haze disappears there and the scene behind shows through as a
// one-device-pixel picket right across the grandstand. That is the defect reported as
// "banding in background", and no shipped setting touches it -- twenty configurations were run and fourteen
// are byte-identical to the base, because every shipped lever is about where the sprite lands or
// how a texel is filtered, and this draw is placed correctly and filtered correctly. The error is
// WHICH texel a device pixel reads. (Measured 2026-09-20.)
//
// So the rule: A SPRITE THAT MINIFIES A GS-MEMORY TEXTURE UNDER A NEAREST SAMPLER READS THE TEXEL
// ITS NATIVE PIXEL WOULD HAVE READ. The 2x2 device pixels of one native pixel all take that native
// pixel's texel, which is exactly the picture native produces, enlarged.
//
// The scope is the point of the file, so each gate is a fact and not a taste:
//
//   * SPRITE, because only a sprite has the one-sample-per-pixel rule in this form. A triangle's
//     texture coordinate is interpolated and a device fragment's own sample point is the honest
//     answer for it.
//   * FROM GS MEMORY, because a render-target source is already at device resolution -- its texels
//     ARE device texels and there is no native grid to go back to.
//   * NEAREST, because a bilinear sprite is already averaging in the texels the console skipped.
//     That is a different picture and not this one's business.
//   * NO MIPMAP, because the level the console picked is a function of this same step, and the two
//     have to be settled together rather than one of them moved on its own.
//   * MINIFYING, at least two source texels per native pixel, because that is when the console
//     starts skipping texels. At a step of one nothing is skipped and there is nothing to restore.
//   * SCALE ABOVE 1, which is where a native pixel has more than one device pixel to disagree
//     about. At native the rule below is the identity, term for term, so 1x cannot move.
//   * THE DEVICE GRID IS THE NATIVE GRID SCALED -- a vertex at native coordinate n has to land at
//     device coordinate n * scale + 0.5, because that and nothing else makes floor(fragment)/scale
//     the fragment's OWN native pixel. Several half-pixel-offset modes deliberately put the
//     vertices somewhere else: GameDB `halfPixelOffset: 4` (Native) places them at
//     scale * (n + 0.5), so at 2x native 0 lands at device 1.0 rather than 0.5. Snapping on that
//     mapping hands the fragment a native pixel that is not its owner. Measured: Katamari Damacy's
//     two dumps are the corpus's Native-mode draws, they land at device 1.0 and 3.0 for native 0
//     and 1, and correcting them is a wash against the software renderer at native (exact
//     agreement 15.1% -> 15.0% on the pixels that move); with the mapping put back to
//     n * scale + 0.5 the same draws go 5.6% -> 19.8% exact and mean error 31.73 -> 17.25. So a
//     draw on another mapping is refused here rather than corrected on the wrong grid. Reading
//     the mapping the renderer actually used, and correcting for it, is a better rule and a
//     different change; this gate is what keeps the wrong answer off the screen until then.
//   * NOT A FIELD RENDER. In field mode (SMODE2.FFMD under an interlaced output) the game draws
//     half-height fields, and at an integer upscale of 2 or more the merge presents that field
//     render as the whole picture rather than weaving it -- because each field line now occupies
//     that many device rows, and those rows carry the display lines BETWEEN the field's own
//     (`field_render_is_whole_picture` in GSRenderer.cpp, `present_field_direct` in
//     GSInterlaceModePolicy.h). Those in-between lines are precisely what this rule removes: it
//     gives every device row of a native row the same texel. So in field mode the device picture
//     is deliberately not the native picture enlarged, and the derivation below does not hold.
//     Measured: Armored Core 3 and Shin Onimusha are the corpus's only FFMD dumps, and corrected
//     they move away from the software renderer at native (Armored Core 3, exact agreement
//     15.1% -> 4.9%) -- but with the field composition out of the way the same draws move hard
//     toward it (3.7% -> 38.6% exact, mean error 26.77 -> 6.31). The rule picks the right texel
//     for them and the composition discards it. That composition is a separate problem; this gate
//     keeps this rule out of its way. Interlaced OUTPUT is not the condition and does not gate
//     anything -- NASCAR's output is interlaced too, and its targets are whole 640x448 frames.
//
// A note on what is NOT gated, and why. The step is read per AXIS: NASCAR's draws are 2:1 in U and
// 1:1 in V, so U snaps and V is left alone. And the step is read per SPRITE and the draw is refused
// unless every sprite in it walks the texture at the same rate, because the shader carries one step
// for the whole draw. Sprite PHASE is free -- the correction below is derived from the fragment's
// own position, not from an anchor, so sprites at different offsets each snap to their own grid.
//
// The arithmetic, once, because the shader repeats it and the two must not drift.
//
// The console evaluates a sprite's texture coordinate at the pixel's INTEGER coordinate, not at its
// centre, and the renderer carries that convention up the scale: device pixel j samples where
// native coordinate j/S samples. (Measured, not assumed -- NASCAR's right-half draw runs U from 0.5
// over 2 texels per native pixel from screen column 320, and device column 700 reads texel 60 while
// 701 reads 61, which is 0.5 + 2*(j/S - 320) floored and nothing else. Sampling at the centre would
// put column 700 half a texel lower, and the first build written that way lost the haze on every
// column, because half a texel is the whole difference between the texels the console shows and the
// ones it never does.)
//
// So the device pixel samples at j/S, its owner native pixel sampled at floor(j/S), and the
// correction in native pixels is
//
//     floor(j/S) - j/S
//
// which is the texture coordinate's own step times that. Two things fall out. At S = 1 it is
// floor(j) - j, zero for every pixel: the identity, by construction and not by measurement. And
// floor(j/S) is the ownership rule the dither and SCANMSK paths use -- native pixel k owns device
// pixels [ceil(kS), ceil((k+1)S)) -- so a fractional scale lands on the same owners those do, as
// long as j is the INTEGER pixel index and the divide is a real divide.
//

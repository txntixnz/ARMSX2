// Which texel a device pixel reads when a sprite MINIFIES a GS-memory texture under a nearest
// sampler.
//
// The console evaluates a sprite's texture coordinate once per pixel, so a sprite stepping two
// texels per pixel never displays the texels in between, and games rely on that. NASCAR Thunder
// 2002 draws its distance haze from a 640-texel PSMT8 overlay across 320 pixels, with haze alpha in
// the even texels and alpha 0 in the odd ones. Upscaled, every device column gets its own sample
// point, the odd texels land on every second column, and the haze shows as a one-pixel picket.
// No placement or filtering setting affects this; the error is which texel is read.
//
// Rule: such a sprite reads the texel its native pixel would have read, so all device pixels of one
// native pixel take that native pixel's texel -- the native picture, enlarged.
//
// Gates:
//
//   * SPRITE: a triangle's coordinate is interpolated, and the fragment's own sample point is
//     correct for it.
//   * FROM GS MEMORY: a render-target source is already at device resolution; there is no native
//     grid to return to.
//   * NEAREST: a bilinear sprite already averages in the skipped texels.
//   * NO MIPMAP: the console's level depends on the same step, so the two would have to change
//     together.
//   * MINIFYING, at least two texels per native pixel, which is when texels get skipped.
//   * SCALE ABOVE 1. At native the correction is the identity term for term.
//   * THE DEVICE GRID IS THE NATIVE GRID SCALED: native n must land at device n * scale + 0.5, or
//     floor(fragment)/scale is not the fragment's own native pixel. Some half-pixel-offset modes
//     place vertices elsewhere (GameDB `halfPixelOffset: 4` puts native 0 at device 1.0 at 2x), and
//     correcting on that grid picks the wrong owner. Those draws are refused rather than corrected
//     on the wrong grid.
//   * NOT A FIELD RENDER (SMODE2.FFMD under interlaced output). At integer scale >= 2 the merge
//     presents a field render as the whole picture (`field_render_is_whole_picture` in
//     GSRenderer.cpp, `present_field_direct` in GSInterlaceModePolicy.h), so the extra device rows
//     carry the display lines between the field's own. This rule would flatten exactly those rows.
//     Interlaced output alone does not gate anything.
//
// Not gated: the step is read per AXIS (NASCAR is 2:1 in U and 1:1 in V, so only U snaps). Every
// sprite in the draw must share one step, because the shader carries one step per draw. Sprite
// phase is free: the correction comes from the fragment's own position, not an anchor.
//
// The arithmetic, which the shaders repeat and must not drift from:
//
// The console samples at the pixel's INTEGER coordinate, not its centre, and the renderer keeps
// that convention: device pixel j samples where native coordinate j/S samples. Sampling at the
// centre is half a texel off, which on NASCAR selects the skipped texels.
//
// The owner native pixel sampled at floor(j/S), so the correction in native pixels is
//
//     floor(j/S) - j/S
//
// times the coordinate's step. At S = 1 it is zero for every pixel. floor(j/S) is the same
// ownership rule the dither and SCANMSK paths use -- native pixel k owns device pixels
// [ceil(kS), ceil((k+1)S)) -- so fractional scales agree with them, provided j is the INTEGER pixel
// index and the divide is a real divide.
//

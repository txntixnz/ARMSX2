// Which road a backend takes for a draw that reads the render target it is also writing, and what
// that road implies for texture barriers, the in-tile read and primitive ordering.
//
// Those four bits used to be decided by four expressions a hundred and fifty lines apart in
// GSDeviceVK::CheckFeatures -- the framebuffer-fetch decision, `OverrideTextureBarriers != 0`, the
// driver database's RT-copy workaround, and `framebuffer_fetch &= texture_barrier`. Reading them
// in order is the only way to find out which road a device is on, and the same shape in the OpenGL
// fetch decision is what let a driver guard turn fetch off and a profile block turn it straight
// back on 0.1 ms apart in one log (see the note at the top of GSFramebufferFetchPolicy.h).
//
// THE THREE ROADS
//
//   Copy           -- the target is snapshotted into its own texture, the render pass ends, and the
//                     draw samples the snapshot. Always correct, the most expensive thing we have,
//                     and structurally wrong for primitives that overlap WITHIN one draw: every
//                     such primitive composites against the same pre-draw snapshot.
//   InPassBarrier  -- the draw reads the live attachment, and the ordering comes from explicit
//                     pipeline barriers the backend emits (one per draw, or one per primitive group
//                     when the draw's own primitives overlap). Desktop's road.
//   InPassOrdered  -- the draw reads the live attachment and the DRIVER orders it, so no barrier is
//                     emitted at all. Two ways to earn that, and they are different mechanisms:
//                     the in-tile read under Vulkan rasterization-order attachment access, and the
//                     declared attachment feedback loop, measured here on Adreno.
//
// THE SPELLING IS A SEPARATE AXIS, and conflating it with the road is how a July 2026 attempt
// produced an unreadable result. Which shader variant, image layout, image usage bit and descriptor
// type the read uses is decided ONCE at device creation and cannot move afterwards:
//
//   Clone              -- texelFetch of a separate copy (GSDeviceVK's draw_rt_clone).
//   InputAttachment    -- subpassLoad of the attachment as a subpass input.
//   FeedbackLoopLayout -- texelFetch of the live attachment in
//                         VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_ATTACHMENT_FEEDBACK_LOOP_OPTIMAL_EXT, with the matching
//                         VK_PIPELINE_CREATE_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_FEEDBACK_LOOP_BIT_EXT on every
//                         pipeline bound while it is in that layout.
//
// Desktop already runs FeedbackLoopLayout + InPassBarrier every day: it advertises
// VK_EXT_attachment_feedback_loop_layout and not the rasterization-order extension, so
// GSDeviceVK::UseFeedbackLoopLayout() is already true there and the pipeline create flag already
// fires. Nothing about the declaration is new or untested -- what is new is reaching that spelling
// on a driver that also advertises the rasterization-order extension, and dropping the barriers.
//
// WHY THE ARM EXISTS
//
// On Adreno under Turnip the in-tile read returns render-pass-START content: writes sit unresolved
// in tile memory while the fetch goes out through UCHE, which is invalidated once per subpass begin
// rather than per draw. The driver database says so (vk-turnip-attachment-self-read) and puts every
// Adreno on Turnip onto the Copy road. That rule is about the TILED in-tile read, which is what it
// was measured on.
//
// Turnip refuses to tile a render pass at all when a pipeline bound in it declares a feedback loop
// that may involve textures, and it decides that before its bandwidth autotuner is consulted. On
// the untiled path the same declaration programs GRAS_SC_CNTL.SINGLE_PRIM_MODE =
// FLUSH_PER_OVERLAP_AND_OVERWRITE, the documented bypass-mode coherent-blend value. So the
// application can ask for an untiled pass with a coherent, primitive-ordered destination read using
// nothing but a standard extension. That configuration had never been on a device: the one attempt
// at it (2026-07-26, on a branch since deleted) predated the pipeline create
// flag by three days, and the create flag is the single thing Turnip keys the sysmem decision on.
//
// ⚠️ THE GRANULARITY IS THE RENDER PASS, NOT THE DRAW. One declared pipeline untiles every other
// draw sharing the pass, and our passes are deliberately coalesced. That bill has to be measured
// per title; nothing in this header reduces it.
//
// ⚠️ THE ORDERING IS PER PIXEL, NOT PER TARGET. FLUSH_PER_OVERLAP_AND_OVERWRITE orders primitives
// that cover the same sample. A read of a DIFFERENT pixel that an earlier primitive in the same
// draw wrote is not covered -- exactly the limit the in-tile read has. GSSelfReadCopyPolicy.h is
// where that is handled, and it takes `declared_feedback_loop_orders_overlap` for the purpose: an
// offset read on this road keeps its one barrier, which the untiled pass honours, and takes no copy.
//
// THREE ENTRANCES TO THE DECLARED ROAD, and they are not the same kind of thing.
//
// `driver_orders_declared_loop` and `driver_prefers_declared_loop_with_barriers` are the shipping
// two: the driver database recognising, respectively, a driver build measured to order overlapping
// self-reads inside a declared loop (Turnip on a6xx carrying the fix) and a part whose best
// in-pass road is that loop with our own barriers left in place (Turnip on a7xx). Both put a user
// on the road with no setting touched. A user on any other driver gets exactly what they got
// before, because no other driver has been measured.
//
// They differ only in the barriers, and that is not a detail -- it is the whole of what was
// measured. The a7xx part takes the same declaration and keeps the barriers because Turnip never
// emits the ordering state there, so dropping them races.
//
// `arm` is the harness's -declare-feedback-loop -- measurement scaffolding, so one binary can run
// base against the candidate on a device. It is a process global the runner sets
// (GSSelfReadRoadPolicy::SetForcedArm below), not a setting: no INI key, no per-game entry, no UI
// row, because a user cannot tell which road their driver wants. It still wins where it is set,
// because the declared loop with barriers kept (value 2) on our own driver is the reference
// picture the ordering claim is measured against.
//
// Written as a pure function so every no-change case is pinned without the device that takes the
// changed one. See gs_self_read_road_tests.cpp.

	/// about it. Two drivers, and NEITHER of them orders -- for different reasons, both in mesa at
	/// c71af679f08:
	///
	/// - Turnip EMITS the ordering mode and does not deliver it. A declared loop forces sysmem
	///   (tu_cmd_buffer.cc:5568) and sets SINGLE_PRIM_MODE = FLUSH_PER_OVERLAP_AND_OVERWRITE for
	///   `feedback_loops` -- the same enum on the same register it uses for ROAA
	///   (tu_pipeline.cc:3813), and that forced sysmem is also why a pass census on the device counted
	///   zero tiled passes on declared passes. The term is unchanged in the device's own release (introduced
	///   a99600322c1, an ancestor of mesa-26.1.2; the function diffs empty against our clone).
	///   ⚠️ **And the picture still moves and still races.** On an Adreno 650, claiming ordering
	///   moves 47 of 94 corpus cells and is nondeterministic in 20 of them -- worst case 11
	///   distinct outputs from 11 runs, against an arm that keeps the barriers and never once
	///   disagreed with itself over 658 runs. Whether that is
	///   the distro's build, our own pipelines, or the mode not doing what its name says is
	///   unseparated.
	/// - Honeykrisp does not even emit it. It advertises the layout extension
	///   (hk_physical_device.c:144) and has no ordering machinery anywhere in src/asahi/vulkan.
	///   Claiming ordering there moves 70 of 94 corpus cells.
	///
	/// ⚠️ **The strongest case for this guard is the first bullet**: the one driver whose source
	/// says it orders, measurably does not. Reading the emission and concluding the behaviour is
	/// exactly the mistake this comment existed to prevent, and its first version made it.
	///
	/// ⚠️ **So nothing a device ADVERTISES may set this**, and nothing ever will: the extensions do
	/// not promise ordering and the one driver whose source emits it does not deliver it. Two
	/// inputs set it, and both name a specific driver build rather than a capability:
	///
	/// - `driver_orders_declared_loop`, the driver database recognising a build that was MEASURED
	///   to order. That is the shape the paragraph above asked for -- false unless that driver has
	///   been measured, so an unrecognised driver keeps its barriers and comes out
	///   correct-and-slower instead of fast-and-wrong. What earns it today: a Turnip build carrying
	///   the a6xx feedback-loop fix, on which the barrier-dropping road came out byte-identical to
	///   the barrier-keeping reference over the corpus and faster than the copy road on the titles

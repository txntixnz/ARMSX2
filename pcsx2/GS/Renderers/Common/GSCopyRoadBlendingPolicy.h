// What blending accuracy a title renders at on a device where reading the destination costs
// something on every draw that does it.
//
// Accurate blending above Minimum makes a draw read the destination colour. How much that costs is
// not a property of the setting, it is a property of the device's destination read, and the four
// roads are a long way apart -- GSRenderer's device-loss report names them in these same words:
//
//   * in-tile framebuffer fetch -- the read is a subpassLoad out of tile memory. Free.
//   * texture barrier -- the read is a real sample of the live attachment, ordered by a pipeline
//     barrier the backend emits per draw. Cheap on an immediate-mode GPU, which is where the
//     barrier was designed; NOT cheap on a tiler, where the driver answers each barrier with a
//     cache flush and a wait for the pipeline to drain.
//   * render-target copy per primitive group -- the no-barrier fallback on an immediate-mode GPU
//     (D3D11, desktop GL). A blit is a blit there.
//   * render-target copy per DRAW -- the no-barrier fallback on a tiler. Each read ends the render
//     pass, stores the tile, copies the target and starts a new pass. This is the expensive one,
//     and it is where every Adreno under ARMSX2 #442 sits.
//
// On the copy road the price is not marginal. Measured on Splashdown (SLUS-20686) on an
// SD865 under Turnip at native scale: 1,169 of its 2,690 draws a frame read the render target,
// which is 1,192 render passes and 1,177 target copies per frame, and a 32.18 ms p95 against a
// 16.67 ms budget. Holding that one title's blending accuracy down to Minimum collapses it to 24
// passes and 8 copies and 23.70 ms -- 8.48 ms, 26% of the frame, off one setting. At 2x the same
// change is worth 1.20 ms, because the frame has become fill-bound and the saving is on the
// submission side.
//
// ⚠️ THE BARRIER ROAD ON A TILER IS THE SAME PROBLEM, and this file said the opposite until it
// was measured. It used to reason that a texture barrier means the read is cheap, so the cap should lift the
// moment a device has one. That is true of the GPUs the barrier came from and false of the ones we
// ship to. Measured on an Adreno 740 (Turnip): Splashdown's
// 4,678 destination-read draws per four frames stop being fixed-function blends and become software
// blends, each promoted to a full barrier, 59,023 barriers a run, and the frame goes from 24.76 ms
// to 34.80 ms -- +40% on the title that was already the slowest. With the cap applied on that same
// road the barriers go to zero, the draw calls, passes and copies come back to the copy road's
// exactly, and the frame is 25.06 ms: 1.012x the copy road. Pricing the barrier itself on the same device:
// dropping WAIT_FOR_IDLE from the driver's in-pass flush recovers 16-18% -- so what a barrier costs
// there is a wait for the whole pipeline, per draw.
//
// It costs picture. Blending accuracy is exactly what the level controls, so this is not a free
// win being withheld by caution: about 30% of Splashdown's frame moves, by up to 40 levels out of
// 255, across the water spray behind the boat. The Minimum picture was rendered on the device,
// compared against the full-accuracy one, and judged acceptable; that judgement is
// the authority for this file, since a speed change whose only cost is moved pixels is a call on
// the picture, not on byte identity. The road makes no difference to the picture that was judged:
// on the M2 at 1x the capped barrier road is byte-identical to the copy road, 3/3 frames, row for
// row over all 10,793 drawlog rows.
//
// So the behaviour is: ON A DEVICE WHERE READING THE DESTINATION COSTS SOMETHING PER DRAW,
// SPLASHDOWN RENDERS WITH MINIMUM BLENDING ACCURACY. Everywhere else it renders exactly as it did.
//
// Which barrier roads count is a measurement, not a guess about tilers. The two devices timed on
// the barrier road are an Adreno 740 under Turnip and an M2 under Honeykrisp, and the backend says
// so in FeatureSupport::barrier_read_costs_per_draw. Desktop Vulkan and GL also sit on a barrier
// road; the barrier is cheap on an immediate-mode GPU, nobody measured otherwise, and they keep
// the blending level they had before this file existed.
//
// The scope is the point of the file, and the scope is the ROAD, not one device fact. Where the
// driver orders the read for us -- Mali's in-tile fetch, and the declared feedback loop on a
// Turnip build measured to order one (the a6xx road) -- the destination read
// is free, there is nothing for the cap to buy, and the better picture stays. Where we pay for the
// read on every draw that takes one, by copying the target or by emitting a barrier, the cap
// applies. Those are the two answers, and DestinationReadCostsPerDraw below is where they are
// decided.
//
// Which device fact. NOT the driver workaround bit (DriverWorkaround::UseRenderTargetCopyForFeedback)
// that puts Adreno on the copy road, even though that bit is what motivated this work. The bit names
// one cause; the road has others -- an explicit OverrideTextureBarriers=0, a GLES part with no
// fetch extension, a future driver entry nobody has written yet -- and a title's picture should not
// depend on which cause landed the device on the road. It is also the difference between a rule
// that can be tested here and one that needs the device: the road is what the backend publishes, so
// the M2 reproduces every Adreno road with a single settings key and every no-change case is pinned
// at compile time.
//
// This still retires itself, on the road it was always meant to leave. The road is read from the
// live device every time the renderer opens or the settings change, so the day an Adreno reaches a
// driver-ordered destination read -- the a6xx fix shipping, or an a7xx driver that finally orders a
// declared loop -- the cap stops applying there with nothing in this file edited.
//
// The player still outranks all of it, one layer up. The cap arrives as a GameDB hardware fix
// (copyRoadMaximumBlendingLevel), so claiming accurate_blending_unit for the game -- or turning on
// manual hardware fixes -- makes applyGSHardwareFixes skip it and never set the field this policy
// reads. Nothing here needs to know about that; it sees a title that asked for nothing.
//
// And the cap ships in the mobile GameDB overlay only, which the ARM64 Linux build also carries. A
// desktop GPU in such a machine would load the entry, and barrier_read_costs_per_draw is what keeps
// the barrier road from applying it there.
//
// Levels are plain integers, 0 = Minimum through 5 = Maximum, which is the grammar the database
// key already speaks and what keeps this header free of Config.h. See
// gs_copy_road_blending_tests.cpp.

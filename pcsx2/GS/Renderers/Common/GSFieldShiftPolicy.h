// Does this game move its projection half a display line between fields?
//
// In field mode a game draws a half-height field. Some titles draw the identical picture on both
// fields; others move the projection half a display line, so consecutive field renders are one
// native line apart and only line up after one of them is shifted. When the field render is
// presented directly (integer upscale of 2 or more, see GSInterlaceModePolicy.h) that shift is the
// only correction left: apply it for the second kind, and applying it to the first kind is what
// makes a still picture jitter a line every frame.
//
// The test is the one first run offline: mean absolute difference between two consecutive fields at
// three vertical alignments, 0 and +-S device rows. The pictures compared are MERGES, so whatever
// offset the merge itself applied has to come back out -- that is what applied_delta_rows is for.

// with its clamp -- the TEXTURE's first row.
//
// That is the rect's own first row only when the rect starts at the texture top. It usually does:
// the rect begins at DISPFB.DBY (plus any whole-page offset between the display pointer and the
// target's base), and every field-mode title that shifts has DBY = 0. When it does not, the clamp
// returns rows the circuit does not own, so the merge draws the band itself instead, every row of
// it sampling the centre of the rect's first texel row.
//
// The band is exactly `shift_rows` destination rows deep -- a destination row is in it when its
// centre maps above the rect, which is r + 0.5 < dst_top + shift_rows -- so it abuts the shifted
// main draw with no gap and no overlap, and the first row below it samples the same texel row the

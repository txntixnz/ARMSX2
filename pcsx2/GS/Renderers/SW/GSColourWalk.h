// How the GS interpolates a gouraud colour across a triangle.
//
// Everything here is in the pipeline's own colour unit -- one unit is 1/128 of a
// colour level, which is the grid vertex colours arrive on (GSRendererSW builds
// them as byte << 7).  Fog rides the same interpolator in the same unit, carried
// in t.w, and takes every rule below unchanged.
//
// Measured on real hardware.  Five properties, each fitted on the geometry that
// isolates it and then scored together:
//
//   1. THE GRADIENT IS TEN BITS.  The setup's own product -- a channel delta
//      times the cross product's eight-bit truncated reciprocal -- is then
//      truncated toward zero to 1/8 of a unit, which is ten fractional bits of a
//      colour level.
//
//   2. THE WALK INSIDE A BLOCK IS COARSER STILL.  It ramps by gc, the gradient
//      truncated toward zero to a multiple of eight units (a sixteenth of a
//      level), and makes the difference up in one jump of dw = W*(g - gc) -- a
//      whole number of units.  W of those ramps and one jump is exactly W*g, so
//      a whole block still steps the true gradient.
//
//   2b. THE BLOCK IS EIGHT PIXELS WIDE ONLY WHEN TEXTURING, FOG AND AA1 ARE ALL
//      OFF, and four if any one of them is on.  Nothing else about the walk
//      changes with it, and the three do not compound: blending, a depth test
//      with depth writes, and a 16-bit or 24-bit target all leave the draw
//      byte-identical to the plain one.  The width belongs to the DDA and not to
//      the texture function -- a draw with TCC=0 takes the four-wide block on the
//      ALPHA channel, which never enters the texture unit.  The FOG lane takes
//      the same width as colour on every factor.  GSBlockWalk.h has the rest.
//
//   3. THE PRIMITIVE HAS ONE ANCHOR, not one per section.  Order the vertices
//      the hardware's way: top is the smallest y, ties to the smaller x; bottom
//      is the largest y, ties again to the smaller x; the third is the middle.
//      The spine runs top to bottom.  The walk goes right when the middle vertex
//      is right of the spine at its own y, left otherwise.  The anchor is the
//      spine end furthest AGAINST the walk -- the smaller-x end walking right,
//      the larger-x end walking left, ties to the top.
//
//   4. THE BLOCKS ARE PINNED TO ABSOLUTE X, per primitive, unchanged row to row.
//      S is the anchor's x rounded to the grid the walk starts on: up to an even
//      pixel walking right, down to an odd one walking left -- the same rounding
//      at either width.  A = S + 2d is the pixel where the value is the plane
//      exactly, also at either width, and phase is S's position in the W-pixel
//      period.
//
//   5. THE ROWS COME IN ABSOLUTE PAIRS.  A row's plane is evaluated at the even
//      row of its pair when the anchor is the top of the spine and at the odd
//      row when it is the bottom; the other row of the pair is the first plus
//      one coarse vertical step gyc.
//
// So a pixel is
//
//     V(x, y) = P(yf) + (y - yf)*gyc + (x - A)*gc + d*dw*j
//     P(yf)   = aR + tz8(g*(A - xR)) + tz8(gy*(yf - yR))
//     j       = floor(d*(x - S) / W)
//
// with tz8 truncating toward zero to 1/8 of a unit and yf the pair's own row.
// The horizontal tz8 is measured -- a half-pixel anchor separates toward-zero
// from exact, from floor and from round-half-up.  The vertical one is the same
// operation by symmetry: every vertex y we could measure is a whole number, so it
// is not separately pinned.
//
// WHAT THIS MEANS FOR THE SCANLINE, which is the point of the shape.  Take an
// absolute base xv that is a multiple of eight -- which is a multiple of W at
// either width -- and a lane i measured from it:
//
//     V(xv + i) = base(xv) + off[i],  off[i] = i*gc + dw*floor((i - phase) / W)
//     base(xv + 8) = base(xv) + 8g,  exactly, at either width
//
// The second line is why the eight-entry table below serves both widths: eight
// pixels is one block or two, and either way they advance by 8g.  At W = 4 the
// offsets repeat with period four, so entry s + 4 comes out equal to entry s and
// a scanline that indexes by `left & 7` reads the same numbers one indexing by
// `left & 3` would.  Nothing in the scanline knows the width.
//
// The derivation, once, because the closed form above is where a width mistake
// would hide.  With d = +1 and r = S mod W, the block index at x is
// j(x) = floor((x - S) / W), so between the base and lane i
//
//     j(xv + i) - j(xv) = floor((i - r)/W) - floor(-r/W)
//
// and the second term is a constant that cancels in every difference the tables
// hold.  With d = -1, j(x) = floor((S - x)/W) and the same subtraction gives
// -floor((r - i)/W) = floor((i - (r+1))/W) + 1, a constant again, so phase is
// r + 1 there.  Hence one expression for both directions, with
// phase = (d > 0 ? S : S + 1) & (W - 1).
//
// So the walk is still "seed, add a lane table, add a per-vector step", and the
// per-vector step is constant when the vector is a whole number of blocks and
// alternates when a block is two vectors.  On a four-lane host that is the split
// GSBlockWalk.h describes at W = 8 and no split at W = 4, and it falls out of the
// same table: the two phases of the pair come out equal.
// GSDrawScanline::SetupColourWalkTables builds all of it, once per primitive.

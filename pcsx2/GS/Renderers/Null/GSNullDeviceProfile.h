// Which device the deviceless Null device pretends to be.
//
// `-renderer nullhw` runs the real GSRendererHW against GSDeviceNone to price the CPU half of a
// frame with no GPU behind it. That only measures anything if the renderer takes the same CPU
// decisions it would take on the device the number is about, and a large number of those decisions
// read GSDevice::FeatureSupport. GSDeviceNone used to leave it default-constructed -- every bit
// false but dual_source_blend -- which is not any real device, and the difference is not small:
// with fast_stencil_shadow off, auto-flush cuts Jak II's shadow-volume alpha counter into
// one-to-three-triangle draws and the null arm reported 4,836 draws a frame at 2x where the SD865
// runs 1,479. A 3.3x error in the headline counter, produced silently.
//
// So the null device is handed a named profile: the RESOLVED feature set of a device we actually
// run on, copied from that device's own start-up banner and from the rules in
// GSGPUDriverProfile.cpp that produced it. It is a table, not a re-derivation -- GSDeviceVK reaches
// these values through extension queries, limits and the driver-bug database, none of which exist
// here, and a second implementation of that logic would drift from the first without anyone
// noticing. When a device's resolved features change, this table is edited to match, and
// gs_null_device_profile_tests.cpp pins every bit so the edit is deliberate.
//
// ⚠️ The profile is not a claim that the null arm reproduces the device's GPU work. It reproduces
// the device's CPU DECISIONS. Render passes, copies, barriers and area still report n/a, and Draw
// Calls is still a floor (one per RenderHW call, with no backend fan-out).
